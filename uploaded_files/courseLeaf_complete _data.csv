Gordon Mantler (gomantler) (09/09/18 4:34 pm): Rollback: These comments were already shared with the chair via email. But here they are again: While it is clear that students will have several writing-oriented assignments (homework, a writing project, and perhaps the oral presentation) throughout the semester, I could not tell how they build on each other. Nor is it clear if and how the students will revise their writing or conduct peer review of each other’s writing for the purpose of revision. Much of this might be addressed in a detailed course schedule, which was not included. Also, we find that signaling the significance of the course as a WID in the synopsis or course description alerts students to the expectation that they will not only be writing to produce content, but that content is shaped by the particular disciplinary expectations of the class. Something along the lines of the following could work: “This Writing in the Disciplines (WID) course will engage with several forms of writing in Korean conversation and composition.” The learning outcomes should also reflect this WID approach in some manner.",

Gina Harris (gharris) (08/06/19 3:52 pm): Rollback: On the syllabus, the statement re: hours spent in class and in independent learning doesn't cover sufficient hours. A 3-credit course normally would include 2.5 hours of direct instruction and a minimum of 5 hours of independent learning, totaling a minimum of 7.5 hours per week or 112.5 hours per semester. Also, there are only 26 meetings in the class schedule. There should be 27 meetings plus an exam or a final paper due date scheduled during exam week, or 28 meetings if there is no final exam or paper. Please resubmit with updated syllabus.
Phil Troutman (trout) (09/18/19 5:27 pm): Rollback: Rolling back for syllabus revision (email correspondence. w/ Shelley on 18 Sep); the course does not include any peer response work, as required for WIDs.
